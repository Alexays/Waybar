# REWRITE RULES

*rewrite* is an object where keys are regular expressions and values are
rewrite rules if the expression matches. Rules may contain references to
captures of the expression.

Regular expression and replacement follow ECMA-script rules.

If no expression matches, the title is left unchanged.

Invalid expressions (e.g., mismatched parentheses) are skipped.

```
"wayfire/window": {
	"format": "{}",
	"rewrite": {
		"(.*) - Mozilla Firefox": "ðŸŒŽ $1",
		"(.*) - zsh": "> [$1]"
	}
}
```

# STYLE

- *#window*
- *window#waybar.empty #window* When no windows are on the workspace

The following classes are applied to the entire Waybar rather than just the
window widget:

- *window#waybar.empty* When no windows are in the workspace
- *window#waybar.solo* When only one window is on the workspace
- *window#waybar.<app-id>* Where *app-id* is the app ID of the only window on
  the workspace
