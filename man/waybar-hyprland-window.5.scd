# REWRITE RULES

*rewrite* is an object where keys are regular expressions and values are
rewrite rules if the expression matches. Rules may contain references to
captures of the expression.

Regular expression and replacement follow ECMA-script rules.

If no expression matches, the title is left unchanged.

Invalid expressions (e.g., mismatched parentheses) are skipped.

# STYLE

- *#window*
- *window#waybar.empty #window* When no windows are in the workspace

The following classes are applied to the entire Waybar rather than just the
window widget:

- *window#waybar.empty* When no windows are in the workspace
- *window#waybar.solo* When one tiled window is visible in the workspace
  (floating windows may be present)
- *window#waybar.<app_id>* Where *<app_id>* is the *class* (e.g. *chromium*) of
  the solo tiled window in the workspace (use *hyprctl clients* to see classes)
- *window#waybar.floating* When there are only floating windows in the workspace
- *window#waybar.fullscreen* When there is a fullscreen window in the workspace;
  useful with Hyprland's *fullscreen, 1* mode
- *window#waybar.swallowing* When there is a swallowed window in the workspace
