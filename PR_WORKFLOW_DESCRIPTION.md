# PR Workflow Description: Shared Exec Worker Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete workflow used to design, implement, and test the shared exec worker feature for Waybar custom modules. The workflow demonstrates a collaborative approach using multiple AI tools and minimal human intervention.

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Problem Definition and Task Formulation (with ChatGPT)

**Tool:** ChatGPT
**Role:** Strategic planning and task articulation

The user first consulted with ChatGPT to:
- Clearly articulate the problem: duplicate exec processes across multiple Waybar instances
- Define the desired outcome: shared worker backend for custom modules
- Formulate a clear task prompt for implementation
- Establish requirements: backward compatibility, opt-in via config flag

**Output:** A well-structured task description requesting minimal changes to achieve shared exec workers with a `"shared": true` configuration option.

### Stage 2: Initial Analysis and Proposal (with Claude Code)

**Tool:** Claude Code
**Role:** Codebase analysis and architectural design

Upon receiving the task prompt, Claude Code:
1. **Analyzed the codebase** (`/init` command)
   - Examined `src/modules/custom.cpp` and `include/modules/custom.hpp`
   - Reviewed the threading model (`util::SleeperThread`)
   - Studied existing backend patterns (Hyprland IPC, Niri backend)
   - Understood the module factory pattern

2. **Created comprehensive design proposal** (`SHARED_EXEC_PROPOSAL.md`)
   - Singleton backend pattern similar to compositor backends
   - Observer pattern for multiple subscribers
   - Key-based worker identification
   - Complete architecture documentation
   - Implementation plan with file-by-file breakdown
   - Testing strategy and migration guide

**Human input:** User reviewed proposal and said "yeah your proposal sounds really good, seems like you have a thorough understanding of the issue. Get started with a technical implementation"

**Decision rationale:** Gut instinct that the architectural approach was sound.

### Stage 3: Implementation (with Claude Code)

**Tool:** Claude Code
**Role:** Complete code implementation

Claude Code implemented the feature autonomously:

1. **Created new files:**
   - `include/modules/custom_exec_worker.hpp` - Singleton worker backend
   - `src/modules/custom_exec_worker.cpp` - Worker implementation (~250 lines)

2. **Modified existing files:**
   - `include/modules/custom.hpp` - Added shared mode support
   - `src/modules/custom.cpp` - Integrated shared worker logic
   - `meson.build` - Added new source file

3. **Key implementation details:**
   - `WorkerKey` struct for unique worker identification
   - `CustomExecObserver` interface for module notifications
   - `CustomExecWorker` singleton with subscribe/unsubscribe
   - Three worker types: delay, continuous, waiting
   - Thread-safe observer notifications
   - Automatic worker lifecycle management

**Human input during implementation:**
- Approved moving forward with implementation
- Corrected build approach: "output everything to a local file, then tail the local file" (workflow optimization)
- Stopped redundant symbol checking: "No need to check any further, if the binary is built just tell me how to test it"

**Decision rationale:** Trust in the implementation based on Claude Code's demonstrated understanding; practical workflow corrections based on gut instinct.

### Stage 4: Build and Debug (with Claude Code)

**Tool:** Claude Code
**Role:** Compilation and error resolution

1. **Initial build:**
   - Setup meson build system
   - Encountered namespace qualification error

2. **Debug iteration:**
   - Fixed `WorkerKey` type qualification in `custom.cpp`
   - Rebuilt successfully
   - Main `waybar` binary compiled (test failures were pre-existing Catch2 issues)

**Human input:**
- Workflow correction about capturing build output
- Decision to skip further verification when binary built successfully

**Decision rationale:** Pragmatic approach - if it compiles, move to testing.

### Stage 5: Testing (Human-Led)

**Tool:** Built waybar binary
**Role:** Real-world validation

User performed manual testing:
- Launched waybar with trace logging: `./build/waybar -l trace`
- Configured test module with `"shared": true`
- Observed behavior across multiple monitors

**Test configuration:**
```jsonc
"custom/test": {
  "exec": "echo $RANDOM $(date +%s)",
  "interval": 5,
  "shared": true
}
```

**Observed results:**
- ✅ Numbers matched across all screens
- ✅ Values updated simultaneously
- ✅ Confirmed shared worker behavior

**Human input:** "The numbers on each screen match up, indicating to me that the changes are working as expected without further review."

**Decision rationale:** Direct observation confirmed expected behavior.

### Stage 6: Documentation (with Claude Code)

**Tool:** Claude Code
**Role:** Documentation generation

Created documentation files:
1. **`sample-config.md`** - Test configuration and observed results
2. **`PR_WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION.md`** - This workflow document
3. **`SHARED_EXEC_PROPOSAL.md`** - Already created during Stage 2

**Human input:** Request to document the workflow for transparency in the PR.

## Key Characteristics of This Workflow

### Minimal Human Intervention
- **Total human decisions:** ~5-6 interventions across the entire workflow
- **Nature of decisions:** Mostly "proceed" confirmations and workflow corrections
- **Technical decisions:** None - all architectural and implementation choices made by AI

### Trust-Based Collaboration
- User trusted ChatGPT for task formulation
- User trusted Claude Code for:
  - Architectural design
  - Complete implementation
  - Code quality
- Testing was the primary human validation point

### Gut Instinct Validation
Human interventions were based on:
- Intuition that the proposal "sounds really good"
- Workflow optimization instincts (save to file, skip redundant checks)
- Direct observation in testing phase

### AI Tool Specialization
- **ChatGPT:** Strategic planning, task articulation
- **Claude Code:** Codebase analysis, implementation, documentation

## Transparency Note

This PR represents work where:
- **Design and implementation:** 100% AI-generated (Claude Code)
- **Testing:** 100% human-performed
- **Workflow management:** Human-guided with minimal interventions
- **Quality assurance:** Combination of AI architectural understanding and human validation

The user chose to be completely transparent about this workflow to:
1. Demonstrate effective AI-assisted development
2. Allow reviewers to assess the approach's viability
3. Provide insight into modern development workflows
4. Maintain integrity in open-source contributions
