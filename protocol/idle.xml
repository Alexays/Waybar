  <interface  name="org_kde_kwin_idle" version="1">
      <description summary="User idle time manager">
        This interface allows to monitor user idle time on a given seat. The interface
        allows to register timers which trigger after no user activity was registered
        on the seat for a given interval. It notifies when user activity resumes.

        This is useful for applications wanting to perform actions when the user is not
        interacting with the system, e.g. chat applications setting the user as away, power
        management features to dim screen, etc..
